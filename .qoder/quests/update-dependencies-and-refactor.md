# A2A Protocol Client Refactoring and Dependency Update Design

## Overview
This design document outlines the strategy for updating the Java client dependencies to align with the official A2A protocol specification and refactoring both Go and Java implementations to reduce code duplication while preserving all demonstration functionality. The goal is to create leaner, more maintainable clients that adhere to the latest A2A standards.

## Architecture
The refactored architecture will follow a streamlined approach across both implementations:

- **Single Client Class**: Consolidate functionality into one primary client class per language
- **Unified Model Layer**: Maintain shared data models that reflect the A2A protocol specification
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardize exception/error structures
- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure alignment with the official A2A protocol specification from a2aproject/A2A
